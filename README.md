- The submission for this module has two parts; detailed are explained as Goal-A and Goal-B below. - Goal-A  àEach student will be given a dataset and it is expected that you profile and clean the dataset considering the different quality dimensions. - The exam format for Goal-A will be a report submission – the report should not be more than 15-20 pages, following a single column format. o Each student has to submit his/her completed report until 15th March 14:00 in Moodle. o Source code, if any must be zipped and uploaded with the report in Moodle. o The report should not contain any subjective description (general information) but should be specific with objective statements on the steps taken in cleaning the data. - Goal-B à Each student has to also prepare an unclean dataset. - The exam submission for Goal-B will be a short document, recipe/source-code if any and the unclean dataset in either CSV, XL, or a MySQL database dump. 
 
Goal - A a) Data Profiling - Using Talend Data Quality Management tool, you have to document the data profiling steps performed on the dataset - For clear understanding of the profiling steps performed, you can paste the screenshot from the respective tool. 
 
b) Data Cleaning - Mention all the relevant data quality dimension necessary for cleaning the dataset. - Document in detail the steps performed for handling a given quality dimension. - OpenRefine, Talend Data Preparation, or Trifacta can be used for performing the data cleaning process • Bonus point for those who will be showing a comparison of data cleaning features between the 3 above mentioned tools (this task is not mandatory). - The datasets are in CSV format, exporting them in a DB system for performing specific/advance queries is up to each individual. However, that information should be part of the report. - Following questions have to be answered for the task • What insights did you gain from dataset analysis?  • Which all data quality dimension does your analysis fits into?   - Explain the dimension with a use case (the use case can be hypothetical one created by you) - For example, in the classroom tutorial on the Patent dataset, the use case was finding the different countries filing patents; 
*If you wish to use a different dataset than the one provided by us, then please inform us as soon as you possible. 
 
- To answer this use case, the dimensions conformity + consistency + accuracy was considered for the column “PublicationNumber”. • Why did you choose a given technique and the associated actions steps for a task?  - Is there an alternative technique that could have been used?  
 
 
GOAL – B - Creating a Raw dataset refereeing to any online source like kaggle.com. - Conditions on the Raw dataset o Minimum dimensions to be considered while making the dataset Raw are § Accuracy § Completeness § Conformity § Validity § Consistency § Uniqueness § Currency  o You are free to include any other dimension from the Literature. - The dataset must be made at least 25% Raw/Unclean based on the above-stated dimensions. - Every record/set of records that you make unclean should be documented highlighting the quality dimension that is considered. - The recipe/source-code should be also submitted for verification o You can use any or a combination of OpenRefine, Data Preparation, or Trifacta.
